Better messaging when the download has is finished, if there is an error with the download and if there is an error with insertion for test users.

Make it possiple to edit a single user.

Make it possiple to sort users by; firstName, lastName, or email.

Make download file button follow the scroll down.

Make pagination, show only 10, 25 or 50 users pr page. Or have it show all.
